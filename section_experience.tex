		{May 2022}	{Mechatronic Engineer}{CORDEL - Australia}
		{Aug 2019}	{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developing pose and velocity estimation using optic flow and machine learning for more accurate point clouds. Where I utilised many features of the Open CV library in C++ and created many data visualisations for verification and evaluation.
				\item Implementing an Extended Kalman Filter to fuse sensor data, (IMU, RTK GPS, LiDAR) for pose estimation and localisation. This project requires expert knowledge about Bayesian filtering techniques and linear algebra.
				\item Spent a year in New York working remotely developing 3D point extraction from 2D camera footage on a train. I demonstrated my ability to work effectively outside of the office environment and without intervention.

		{Aug 2019}	{Technical Officer}{Airsight - Australia}
		{Apr 2018}	{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented pseudo-RTOS to arbitrate commands over the serial port with tasks running in the background.
				\item Designed PCB and wrote C/assembly code for status indicator board.
				\item Re-designed Base station housing and layout using CAD software. I learned fusion 360 for this task and dramatically improved my industrial design skills.
				\item Manufactured aluminium and carbon fibre components on a CNC using CAM software. This is where I fostered many practical skills in material properties, machinist theory and CNC operations/path planning.
			\end{itemize}

		{Current}	{Founding Member }{Borne Clothing - Australia}
		{Sep 2019}	{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Built parts of our website and fulfilment workflow. This has required me to utilise basic web development skills as well as integrate many different online services.
				\item Formulated an algorithm to calculate the distribution of our product range styles to most efficiently order product styles. For this, I calculated the "velocity" of our products selling and used it to determine the required restock rate.
				\item jointly responsible for running the business day to day. I am continually learning how to best run a business and social enterprise in the leanest way possible.
